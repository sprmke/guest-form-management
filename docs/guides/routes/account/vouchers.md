## Overview

Signed-in guests see next-stay vouchers earned after a completed stay (review + claim). Ready vouchers link to book again at the same property; used vouchers stay listed for history. Wallet cards are compact ticket rows (code + offer + property), not large marketing cards.

---

## Host-facing knowledge

Guests keep vouchers they earned from a previous stay in their account under **Vouchers**. They can apply one when booking the same property again. The discount lowers the stay rate you set at review — it does not change the guest’s downpayment amount.

**Common host questions**

- Q: A guest says they have a voucher but don’t see it on the form.
  A: They must be signed in with the same account/email as the stay that earned it, and they must book the **same** property. Vouchers don’t move between properties.
- Q: Does the voucher change what they pay as downpayment?
  A: No. Downpayment stays as usual. The voucher reduces the booking rate when you review pricing.
- Q: How do I see that a guest used a voucher?
  A: Open the booking → Pricing. You’ll see a **Guest voucher** block and a lower pre-filled booking rate on Review pricing.
