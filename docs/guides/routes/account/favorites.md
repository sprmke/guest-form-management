## Overview

Grid of properties the signed-in guest has "hearted" (saved) while browsing the marketing site. Same save/unsave action as the heart icon on property listing and detail pages — this page is just the guest's saved-properties view. Nav label is **Favorites**.

---

## Host-facing knowledge

This is the guest's favorites list — properties they tapped the heart icon on while browsing. It doesn't affect availability, pricing, or bookings; it's purely a personal shortlist for the guest.

**Common host questions**

- Q: A guest asks why a property disappeared from their favorites.
  A: They likely un-hearted it (there's a confirm step before it's removed), or the listing itself may no longer be public. Favoriting doesn't reserve a stay or hold dates.

## Favorites grid

### Fields (per card)

| Field       | Storage                         | Notes                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Thumbnail   | Property's public listing image | Square crop                |
| Name / meta | Property listing fields         | Same data as explore cards |

### Load path

1. Page mount → `useSavedPropertySlugsQuery` reads saved property slugs for the signed-in guest from **`guest_saved_properties`**.
2. Each slug renders a `WishlistPropertyCard` (fetches its own listing summary).
3. Empty state ("No saved properties.") links to **Browse properties** (`/properties`).

### Unsave path

1. Tap the heart on a `WishlistPropertyCard` → confirm dialog ("Remove from favorites?").
2. Confirm → deletes the guest's row in `guest_saved_properties` for that property (same mutation used by the heart icon on listing/detail pages) → card is removed from the grid.

### Behavior / edge cases

- Grid uses fixed **240px (`15rem`)** tracks (same scale as explore carousels), 2-up on mobile.
- Saving/unsaving from any explore page (listing grid, property detail) is reflected here on next load — there is no separate favorites-only save action.
