## Overview

Platform super-admins review **host verification** (org scope), **listing verification** (per property/parking), and **property external reviews** (Airbnb/Facebook screenshots).

- **Org rows:** organizations where host `baseStatus ≠ none` or `enhancedStatus ≠ none`.
- **Listing rows:** one row per property or parking where listing `baseStatus ≠ none` or `recommendedStatus ≠ none` (scope split — listing docs live on the listing, not the org).
- **Review rows:** flattened from `app_settings.external_reviews`.

Default filters: **Type** = All types, **Status** = In review.

**Consideration (Unit handoff Phase B):** when a sublessee / Auth Rep listing is in the post-contract grace window and the owner submitted **Request consideration** (note + date + proof file upload), the queue shows a **Consideration** badge. The review dialog offers **Grant** / **Deny** per property or parking leg (`decide-contract-consideration`). Grant is blocked if Phase A ACTIVE tower+unit peers exist. Daily lifecycle automation: **`contract-expiry-cron`** (see `supabase/snippets/contract-expiry-cron.sql`). **Manual E2E:** [`docs/guides/testing/contract-expiry-lifecycle-manual.md`](../../testing/contract-expiry-lifecycle-manual.md).

**Access:** `RequireSuperAdmin` (`SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`).

## Host-facing knowledge

The platform team uses this page to approve host identity documents, **request changes** (host can fix and resubmit), or **reject** (hard decline).

**Reject** closes dashboard access for that organization, emails the owner a formal notice, and asks them to start a **new application** with proper documents. **Request changes** keeps shell access but **forces a non-dismissible resubmit modal** on next login until the host uploads the requested documents.

**Common host questions**

- Q: Who reviews my onboarding documents?
  A: The Kame Homes platform team. You’ll see “In review” until they approve, request changes, or decline.
- Q: What if changes are requested?
  A: When you sign in you’ll see a **Changes requested** popup you can’t close. Fix or replace the docs listed, then tap **Resubmit**.
- Q: What if my verification was declined?
  A: You’ll see a **Verification declined** screen when you sign in. Start a **new application** with clear, complete documents. You’ll also receive an email with the decision.
- Q: Does approval unlock my dashboard?
  A: You can use the dashboard after onboarding while verification is pending or approved. Changes requested blocks the UI behind a required resubmit modal. A hard reject blocks access for that organization.

## Behavior / edge cases

- Desktop defaults to a table with a table/grid toggle (same control as Hosts, Developments, Support tickets). Phone/tablet layouts force the card grid.
- **Pagination:** standard admin-list pagination (same pattern as the bookings list) — `page`/`limit` persisted in the URL (`?page=`, `?limit=`), default page size 31 (`ADMIN_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`). `GET list-super-admin-approvals` accepts `page`/`limit`/`type`/`status`/`search`, combines org + listing + review rows, filters, and paginates the combined queue, returning `{ approvals, total, page, limit }`. `AdminListPagination` renders once at the page level below whichever view (table or grid) is active, so page/limit state is shared and does not reset when only the view toggles. Type/Status/search filter state lives in the URL (`?type=`, `?status=`, `?search=`), and changing any of them resets to page 1.
  - **Server-side filtering approach (chosen over a full-table-fetch-then-slice):** the queue unions three heterogeneous sources (organizations, properties+parkings, `app_settings.external_reviews`) with different schemas and no shared sort key, so it can't be expressed as one PostgREST `.range()` call without a dedicated SQL view/RPC. Instead: **Type is pushed all the way down** — `type=reviews`/`listing_verification` skip the other two source queries entirely, and `type=property`/`parking` skip the listing + review queries and filter the org query with `.contains('host_modes', [...])`. **Status and search stay in-memory**, applied to the now much-smaller, type-narrowed row set before the final sort + `.slice()` pagination: statuses are derived from nested `settings` JSONB (listing verification also falls back to reading the _org's_ settings when a listing has no `listingAuthorization` block of its own — see `resolveListingAuthorization` — so a plain JSON-path DB predicate on the listing table would silently miss legacy-fallback rows), and search spans fields that aren't queryable columns on these tables (owner name/email come from the Supabase Auth Admin API, review text lives inside a JSONB array).
  - **Known scale limitation:** with `type=all` (the common case together with the default `status=pending`), the org/listing/review queries still each pull their full "submitted" row set from the DB before the in-memory status/search filter runs — there's no DB-level cap on that yet. This is fine at current org/property/parking counts, but if any of those tables grow into the thousands, revisit with a dedicated Postgres function that unions + filters + orders + paginates in one query (see `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` conventions in existing migrations) — flagged here as the follow-up, not implemented.
- Search filters org rows by organization name, owner name, and owner email; review rows by property name, organization name, review text, reviewer name, and source.
- **Type filter:** All types / Property / Parking / **Listing verification** / Reviews. Property and Parking filter **org** rows by `hostModes`. Listing verification shows listing-scoped rows only. Reviews shows external review rows only.
- Status filter: All / In review / Approved / Changes requested / Rejected. Default: In review. Review rows use pending / approved / rejected only (no changes-requested).
- Queue order: orgs with **Recommended in review** (`enhancedStatus === pending`) appear first; within each group, newest submit first (Tier 2 submit time when set, else Tier 1).
- Dialog title shows tier under review: **Verified** (Tier 1) or **Recommended** (Tier 2). When both tiers were submitted, a **Verified / Recommended** tab switcher shows both statuses; admins can review either tier independently (including Recommended while Verified is still pending).
- Org dialog documents are **host-only:** Tier 1 = Valid ID; Tier 2 = Facebook Page screenshot, selfie, platform admin screenshot, optional legitimacy/BIR. Listing ownership / Azure PMO docs are **not** shown here — they are reviewed on listing queue rows. A read-only **Listings** rollup at the bottom summarizes per-listing status (`list-org-listing-verifications`).
- Listing dialog: **Verified** (Tier 1) = rights and contract end (no ownership proof required). **Recommended** (Tier 2) = primary ownership/authorization proof + additional proof + Azure PMO confirmation. Property Tier 1 **Approve** with an ACTIVE tower+unit peer shows succession confirm (same handoff as before, now per listing).
- Rows with `hasActiveUnitConflict` show a **Succession** badge (listing property rows; legacy org rows when applicable).
- Each document has **Full view** (nested lightbox dialog) and **Open in new tab**. Images show inline thumbnails; PDFs show a first-page thumbnail (via pdf.js).
- Dialog loads signed preview URLs for stored verification assets (1-hour expiry) on the Supabase project origin.
- Pending actions (order): **Request changes**, **Reject**, **Approve**.
- **Approve** org Tier 1 runs immediately (no listing succession — that is per listing row).
- **Request changes** switches the same modal into a focused step (orange header): required **multi-select** reasons (document-quality checklist), optional documents to fix, optional additional notes, preview **Host will see**, then confirm — **Back** returns to review. Host keeps shell access; on next login a **non-dismissible Changes requested** modal (no X/Close) forces **Resubmit** before using the dashboard. Only the docs selected under “Please re-upload” are shown for upload (stored as `baseChangesRequestedDocs`); other submitted docs are kept.
- **Reject** switches the same modal into a focused step (destructive header): required reason from a **5-option hard-decline dropdown** (fraud, identity mismatch, ownership, fraud history, duplicate/suspicious account), optional additional notes, **Host will see** preview — **Back** returns to review. Sets `baseRejectionKind: 'rejected'`, **emails the owner**, and **blocks** org/property/parking dashboard access. On next login the host sees `/verification-rejected` and may **Start a new application** (`/onboarding`). In-app resubmit is not allowed for hard reject.
- Notes/reason are stored in `baseRejectionReason` with `baseRejectionKind` (`changes` \| `rejected`).
- **Approve** / decide actions only when status is pending; otherwise show badge + Close (and any prior notes/reason).
- Host resubmit after **changes** (`submit-org-verification` `tier: 'base'`) sets status back to pending and clears the rejection reason/kind; the org reappears in the In review queue. Hard-rejected orgs cannot resubmit; owners may create a new organization.
- **External reviews:** one queue row per submitted review. Dialog shows property + org, source, reviewer, rating, review text with **0–3 guest photos**, platform screenshot under **Proof of guest's review**, optional proof URL. **Approve** publishes review text + guest photos on the public property page (screenshot stays internal proof). **Reject** sets `rejected` (hidden from public; host sees Rejected badge + dashboard attention chip). Any host edit to an **approved** or **rejected** review (including proof/stay photo uploads on a saved review) resets **`moderationStatus` to `pending`**, bumps `createdAt`, and re-queues the row for super-admin review; approved content is hidden from the public listing while pending.
