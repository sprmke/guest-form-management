# Host Detail — operator guide

Route: `/admin/hosts/:hostId`

> **Status:** Documented · redesigned 2026-09-05 from a 2-tab shell (`Organizations` /
> `Properties` routed pill tabs) into **one page** with stat cards, search, a **mode dropdown**
> (replaces the tabs), filters, view toggle, and pagination — the same shape as the other
> super-admin list pages. Old `/admin/hosts/:hostId/orgs` and `…/orgs/properties` URLs redirect
> here.

## Progress overview

| Section       | E2E save | Validation | Docs | Notes                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header        | Done     | —          | Done | Avatar/initial, name, email, **← Hosts** back link (`SuperAdminDetailHeader`)                             |
| Stat cards    | Done     | —          | Done | Organizations / Properties / Parking slots (`host.stats`) — the first two double as the mode switch       |
| Mode dropdown | Done     | —          | Done | `Organizations` \| `Properties` — replaces the old pill tabs, URL-persisted `?mode=`                      |
| Organizations | Done     | —          | Done | Search + grid/table view + pagination                                                                     |
| Properties    | Done     | —          | Done | Search + org filter (only shown when the host owns >1 org) + status + type + grid/table view + pagination |

## Overview

One page per host, listing everything they own. Read-only — no create/edit action for either
organizations or properties from here (that happens in the host's own dashboard, or the
[Organization hub](./orgs.md) for plan/approval/AI actions).

**Access:** `RequireSuperAdmin` (`SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`).

---

## Host-facing knowledge

Internal platform-team tooling — a combined lookup of every organization and property a host
owns, across all of their organizations. Hosts never see it.

**Common host questions**

- Q: If I own more than one organization, does the platform team see all of them here?
  A: Yes — every organization you own, and every property under any of them, appears on your host
  profile.
- Q: Can the platform team edit my organization or property settings from here?
  A: No — this page only displays them. Editing happens in your own dashboard, or (for
  plan/verification/support) the platform team's per-organization hub.

## Behavior notes

- **Stat cards** (`StatCard` with `active`/`onClick`) double as the mode switch — clicking
  **Organizations** or **Properties** does the same thing as picking it from the dropdown. Clicking
  **Parking slots** does nothing (parking isn't a separate list here yet — it's counted, not
  browsable, from this page).
- **Mode dropdown** replaces the old `SuperAdminSecondaryNav` pill tabs. State lives in
  `?mode=organizations|properties` (default `organizations`); switching modes clears the search
  query and resets to page 1.
- **Organization filter** (Properties mode only): populated from every org this host owns
  (`useHostOrganizations(hostId, 1, 100)`, fetched once regardless of pagination) and hidden
  automatically when the host owns one org or fewer — filtering by org only matters once there's
  more than one to filter between.
- **View toggle** (`SuperAdminListViewToggle`, shared grid/table icons) reuses the existing
  `SuperAdminHostOrgCard` grid / a plain `Organization · Properties · Parking` table for
  Organizations, and the existing `OrgPropertyCard` grid / `OrgPropertyListRow` list for
  Properties — same card components as before, just reachable via one shared toggle instead of a
  view-mode prop baked into each old page.
- Below `lg`, the view is forced to grid (`useAdminMobileGridViewGuard`) — same rule as every other
  super-admin list.

## API reference

| Action     | Endpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host       | `GET get-host?hostId=` — profile + aggregate stats (`organizationCount`/`propertyCount`/`parkingCount`)                                                                                                          |
| Orgs       | `GET list-host-organizations?hostId=&q=&page=&limit=` — organizations owned by this host + per-org property/parking counts, searched + paginated                                                                 |
| Properties | `GET list-host-properties?hostId=&q=&status=&type=&orgId=&page=&limit=` — properties across this host's orgs (optionally narrowed to one), searched + filtered + paginated, with booking/revenue/occupancy stats |

Both list functions filter and paginate at the database level (`.range()` + `{ count: 'exact' }`,
`orgId` an `.in('organization_id', …)` narrowing) — no full-table fetch.
