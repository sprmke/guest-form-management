# Calendar — legacy route

Route: `/org/:orgSlug/property/:propertySlug/calendar`

> **Status:** Redirect — replaced by **Pricing**.

This legacy URL redirects to `/org/:orgSlug/property/:propertySlug/pricing` with
`replace`, so it does not add an extra browser-history entry.

The pricing UI, permissions, fields, save paths, and owner-managed date blocks are
documented in the [Pricing operator guide](./pricing.md).
