## Overview

Standalone page for accepting an org, property, or parking team invitation from an email link. Shows org branding and invite details, requires Google sign-in, then an explicit **Accept** tap (no auto-accept on load). Invite email must match the signed-in Google account.

---

## Host-facing knowledge

When you invite a teammate, they get an email with a link to this page. They sign in with Google, review the invite, and tap Accept. After that they land in the right dashboard for the invite (organization, property, or parking).

**Common host questions**

- Q: My teammate opened the link but nothing happened — why?
  A: They must sign in with the same Gmail address the invite was sent to, then tap Accept. The page does not join them automatically just by opening the link.
- Q: What if they use a different Google account?
  A: Accept fails until they switch to the invited email (or you send a new invite to the account they actually use).
- Q: Where do they go after accepting?
  A: Organization invites open the org dashboard; property invites open that property; parking invites open that parking dashboard.

## Query params

| Param   | Required | Behavior                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `token` | Yes      | Opaque invite token from the email link                                                                                  |
| `scope` | Optional | `org` · `property` · `parking` — selects which accept API to call; when omitted, UI tries property then parking then org |

Missing/invalid token → error state (invitation not found).

---

## Behavior

1. Load preview via **`get-team-invite-preview`** (public; no JWT).
2. Header: org logo + name; property/parking location line when applicable; role label in body.
3. Signed out → **Continue with Google** (return URL preserves token/scope).
4. Signed in → review card + **Accept** button.
5. Accept calls one of: `accept-org-invite` · `accept-property-invite` · `accept-parking-invite`.
6. On success: invalidate team/org/access queries; set last tenant context; navigate to:
   - Org → `/org/:orgSlug/dashboard`
   - Property → `/org/:orgSlug/property/:propertySlug`
   - Parking → `/org/:orgSlug/parking/:parkingSlug`

Email mismatch, expired, cancelled, or already-accepted invites surface as errors/toasts.
