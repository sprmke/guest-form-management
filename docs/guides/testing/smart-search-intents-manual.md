# Smart search intents — step-by-step manual testing

Manual E2E for **Nearby**, **common-noun concepts**, and **literal / expanded** search on the public marketing site.

**Behavior spec:** [`docs/guides/routes/search.md`](../routes/search.md)  
**Timezone:** Asia/Manila for dates only (geo is WGS84).

### Local fixtures (typeahead See all)

Live `/search` reads **ACTIVE** DB rows (not UI mocks). Seed Azure inventory so each category has ≥3–4 hits:

```bash
docker exec -i supabase_db_guest-form-management psql -U postgres < scripts/dev/seed-search-fixtures.sql
```

Also applied on `supabase db reset` via `supabase/seed.sql`. Marketing mocks (`mockDevelopments` / `mockProperties` / `mockParkingSlots`) include matching Azure names for browse-page demos.

| Sample string | Expect in typeahead                                                     | Verify                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`azure`**   | Developments ≥3, Properties ≥3, Parkings ≥3 → **See all** on each group | Click **See all** on Properties → `/search?where=azure&type=properties&focus=properties` |
| **`monaco`**  | Properties + Parkings (tower/slot names)                                | Entity click deep-links; See all when ≥3                                                 |
| **`kame`**    | Properties → Kame Home (often single-category)                          | Category heading still shown on `/search`                                                |
| **`condo`**   | Concept expansion                                                       | Properties-heavy results                                                                 |
| **`nearby`**  | Single “Uses your location” chip                                        | Not a multi-category See all case                                                        |

## 1. Prerequisites

```bash
./dev.sh   # or UI + local functions already running
```

- At least one ACTIVE property with `settings.latitude` / `longitude` (or Azure North residence for default pin).
- Browser that supports Geolocation (Chrome / Safari). Use https or `localhost`.
- Optional: second listing farther away to verify sort order.

---

## 2. Nearby

### 2.1 Allow location

1. Open homepage → Where → tap **Nearby** (or type `Nearby` → Search).
2. Accept the browser location prompt.
3. Expect URL like `/search?where=Nearby&lat=…&lng=…`.
4. Expect category sections with listings near the pin (not “No matches” for the string Nearby).

### 2.2 Deny location

1. Block location for the site (or dismiss the prompt).
2. Search Nearby.
3. Expect empty state **Location needed** + **Use my location**.
4. Allow location from the CTA → results load without leaving `/search`.

### 2.3 Typeahead

1. Type `ne` / `nearby` (≥2 chars).
2. Expect a Locations row: **Nearby** · Uses your location.
3. Selecting it runs the same geo flow as the chip.

### 2.4 Filters on a Nearby search

1. From a Nearby result set on **All**, note the tab counts (e.g. Properties 6 · Developments 1 · Parkings 5).
2. Press the filters button. It reads **Filter properties** (whichever category it will open) — **no toast should appear**.
3. Expect the Properties tab with the **same count** as its All-view tab, never “No matches”.
4. Expect the sidebar facets to describe that set (property type, price band, bedrooms, amenities, development) rather than empty **None** groups.
5. Expect the **All / Properties / Developments / Parkings** pill strip to **remain visible** while Filters are open — toggle Developments without closing the sidebar.
6. Repeat on the Developments and Parkings tabs; counts must keep matching All.
7. Paste `/search?where=Nearby%20developments&lat=15.1696&lng=120.5598` without `type`; expect it to infer Developments and show Azure North.
8. Repeat `Nearby properties` from Cebu (`10.3157, 123.8854`) and `Nearby developments` from Palawan (`9.8349, 118.7384`); expect a stable, category-specific empty state. The URL/category must not fall back to All.
9. Switch quickly between the three phrases; loading may show a skeleton, but must never flash the previous category’s empty result or rewrite to a stale tab.

### 2.5 Filters on a concept search

1. Typeahead **Condo** → Ideas chip → `/search?where=Condos` with condo results on All.
2. Open **Filters** / Properties tab — expect condo listings + facets (bridge: empty `where`, `type=condo`), not “No matches”.
3. Repeat with **Beaches**: empty inventory is OK; Filters must **not** suddenly list every property.

---

## 3. Concepts (common nouns)

| Query      | Expect                                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Condo`    | Properties (and related) matching CONDO / condo terms; category label |
| `Beaches`  | Coastal / beach-term matches when inventory exists                    |
| `Parking`  | Parking category populated when slots exist                           |
| `Mountain` | Baguio / highland-related terms when present                          |

If local DB has no beach inventory, empty is OK — confirm `meta.intent` is `concept` via Network tab on `search-listings`.

---

## 4. Literal + expanded

| Query                              | Expect                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `kame`                             | Kame Home under **Properties** with count          |
| `Makati`                           | City / listing contains matches; not forced Nearby |
| `Azure`                            | Development / residence matches                    |
| Rare typo-only with zero inventory | Empty; no hallucinated AI results (v1)             |

Expanded: craft a query that fails literal match but contains `condo` as a token (e.g. nonsense + condo) only if useful — confirm `meta.usedSmartFallback` / `intent: expanded` in the JSON response.

---

## 5. Regression smoke

- Dates still hide conflicting properties/parkings.
- Guest counts still filter properties by capacity.
- Smart tabs still hide empty categories; All only when 2+ types match.
- Category headings always visible for non-empty sections.

---

## 5b. Page-aware search bar

1. Open `/developments`, type a query that hits multiple families, press Search.
2. URL includes `focus=developments`; All view lists **Developments** before Properties / Parkings; typeahead showed Developments right after Locations.
3. Repeat from `/properties` → `focus=properties`; from `/parkings` → `focus=parkings`.
4. From `/developments` typeahead, click **Search all results for “…”** → `/search` **without** `focus`.
5. Confirm homepage Search still omits `focus`.

---

## 6. Network checks (optional)

`GET /functions/v1/search-listings?where=Nearby&lat=15.17&lng=120.56`

- `meta.intent === "nearby"`
- `meta.needsLocation === false`
- `totals.all >= 0`

`GET ...?where=Nearby` (no lat/lng)

- `meta.needsLocation === true`
- `totals.all === 0`

---

## 7. Pagination smoke (Phases 1A–1B)

Local only (`./dev.sh`). Confirm page slice + stable totals (no UI change expected).

```bash
# pageSize=2 so page 2 differs with small seed
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANON" -H "apikey: $ANON" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/list-public-properties?page=1&pageSize=2"
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANON" -H "apikey: $ANON" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/list-public-properties?page=2&pageSize=2"
```

Pass when:

| Check        | Expect                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Totals       | Same `total` on page 1 and 2                                                                              |
| Ids          | First ids on page 2 ≠ page 1                                                                              |
| Developments | `list-public-developments` page 1/2 same pattern; `propertyCount` only needed on returned rows            |
| Search       | `search-listings?type=properties&page=1&pageSize=12` returns ≤12 cards                                    |
| Scale        | With >2,000 local ACTIVE rows, `list-public-properties` reports the exact total and reaches the last page |

UI: `/properties` and `/search?type=properties` pager still works; Network payload size stays ~page-sized.

Recorded Phase 1B smoke used 2,107 temporary local properties: page 88 (`pageSize=24`) returned 19 rows with `total: 2107`; one blocked property reduced both total and facet count by one. Temporary rows were removed after the check.
