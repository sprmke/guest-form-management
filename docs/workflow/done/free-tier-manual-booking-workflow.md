# Free-tier manual booking workflow — gaps & completion plan

**Done 2026-08-29.** Free-tier hosts can run the booking graph and manually send all six plan-gated workflow emails from Automation Triggers.

## Locked decisions (2026-08-29)

1. **Multiplexed** `send-booking-workflow-email` (`kind` enum) — keep existing SD + parking endpoints; UI uses the multiplexed path for all six.
2. **No new `*_emailed_at` columns** this pass — only existing `sd_refund_form_emailed_at`.
3. **Email Automations on Free:** disable the six plan-gated toggles + `TierBadge` / upgrade; `emailNewBookingRequest` stays editable.
4. **Parking broadcast:** expose Send when `need_parking` (legacy / unlinked); do not revive as auto on proceed.
5. **Toast:** Upgrade action + expand Automation Triggers with Send buttons.

**Code:** `send-booking-workflow-email` + `_shared/sendBookingWorkflowEmail.ts`; UI Automation Triggers / hooks / settings; docs updated.

**Status summary:** P1 and in-scope P2 closed in code + docs. P3 polish remains deferred (not blocking done).

**Verify (local evidence 2026-08-29):** `ui` `type-check` clean; `eligibleManualWorkflowEmailKinds` unit cases OK. Live Mailpit/Resend walk left as optional operator check.

**E2E (2026-08-30):** `ui/e2e/features/parking/property/propertyBookingFreeManualWorkflow.spec.ts` — Free Automation Triggers Send (GAF / ack / parking + RFCI ready/SD), plan-skip Proceed toast + auto-expand, Find parking still wired.

## Goal

Ensure a property on the **Free** plan can run the full booking lifecycle end-to-end for **host and guest** using **manual** operations where paid automation is gated — without leaving the host stuck sending Azure/guest emails outside the product, and without silent failures or misleading “this will email…” copy.

Paid value remains clear: **Starter+** (`automatedBookingFlow`) auto-sends the six workflow emails. Free must still complete stays via host actions + guest public forms.

**Misconception to kill in docs/UI:** Free does **not** lose PDF generation or the public guest form. Only **automated outbound workflow emails** are paid.

## What’s already shipped

### Phase 5 (2026-08-24)

1. `propertyAutomationToggles.ts` — six keys forced off without `automatedBookingFlow`; `rawPropertyAutomationEnabled` for escape hatches.

5. Automation Triggers Send buttons + plan-skip badge + auto-expand after skip toast.
6. Plan-aware advance guide + confirm/effects email preview.
7. Email Automations: plan-gated toggles locked + TierBadge on Free.
8. Docs: booking-workflow rule, matrix residual closed, bookings-detail guide + Host Q&A, edge-functions inventory, QA 03.

| P3.1  | One sticky **Next step** banner on Free (no AI)                                                  | QA improvement; plain language from status                                                                     |
| P3.2  | After manual Azure send, deep-link to download request PDF                                       | PDF URL already on booking; make one-click download beside Send                                                |
| P3.3  | Co-host / Operations role: ensure `bookings.detail.workflow:edit` covers new send endpoints      | Mirror `send-sd-refund-form-email` permission                                                                  |
| P3.4  | Idempotency / “last sent at” timestamps for GAF/ack/ready/pet (like `sd_refund_form_emailed_at`) | Avoid double-send confusion; optional columns or reuse activity log                                            |
| P3.5  | Downgrade mid-stay: Starter → Free while booking in flight                                       | Next transitions skip emails; ensure toast + manual sends still work; no orphan “expected auto”                |
| P3.6  | Upgrade mid-stay: Free → Starter                                                                 | Later transitions auto-send; don’t double-send if host already manually sent (idempotency markers help)        |
| P3.7  | D2 empty `documentRequirements` (direct PENDING_REVIEW → READY_FOR_CHECKIN)                      | Ack + ready emails both skip on Free — two manual sends                                                        |

| P3.9  | In-app notifications still fire when email gated?                                                | Orchestrator notification gates — confirm Free hosts still get bell for RFCI etc.                              |
| P3.10 | Guest never sees plan tier                                                                       | Guest emails either arrive (manual or auto) or don’t — no plan upsell to guest                                 |
| P3.11 | Org with mix: some properties Free (unenrolled), some paid                                       | Entitlements are per-property enrollment — verify resolvePropertyEntitlements for unenrolled                   |

## Edge cases checklist (must not miss)

### Host / workflow

- [ ] Proceed PENDING_REVIEW with GAF+pet+parking flags on Free → PDFs generated; emails in `automationSkippedByPlan`; status advances
- [ ] Mark GAF/pet complete via upload (manual approval) without email-listener — Free works
- [ ] Email-listener auto-approve path on Free (if property still has Azure inbound) — status advances; ready email still plan-gated
- [ ] Late parking at RFCI+; marketplace fulfill vs manual mark-complete
- [ ] Cancel from any status on Free
- [ ] Guest field edit revert to PENDING_REVIEW on Free — re-proceed regenerates PDFs; emails skip again
- [ ] Admin Return to prior status then re-forward — confirm checkboxes + plan skip don’t contradict
- [ ] SD = 0 path (skip SD form) on Free
- [ ] “Run check-out automation” on Free when balance settled — status vs email behavior documented/tested
- [ ] “Resend Check-out Instructions” on Free when property toggle OFF → 409 (raw toggle) vs plan OK
- [ ] Property Email Automations all OFF on Starter — same as Free for emails, but toast should say host choice not plan (today planBlocked vs toggled-off distinction exists server-side — surface correctly)

### Guest

- [ ] Public form submit on Free property (ops email still fires)
- [ ] Guest never blocked by plan on `/form`, `/sd-form`, stay guide, linked parking marketplace
- [ ] After host manual ack/ready sends, guest receives same templates as paid auto path
- [ ] Guest edit/resubmit sensitive fields → host re-review path still works

### Auth / multi-tenant

- [ ] New send endpoints: `resolveScopedPropertyAccess(..., 'bookings.detail.workflow:edit')` + booking belongs to property
- [ ] Org owner Free property vs invited Operations member
- [ ] Super-admin impersonation / platform paths if any (usually N/A)

### Billing / entitlements

- [ ] Property not enrolled in org subscription → Free entitlements
- [ ] `feature_overrides` on org subscription forcing `automatedBookingFlow` on Free plan row (if used) — respect overrides
- [ ] Commission / Managed / inactive plans — out of product but don’t break resolve

### Failure modes

- [ ] Manual send without request PDF URL → clear 4xx, not 500
- [ ] Resend with Resend API failure → toast error; booking unchanged
- [ ] Double-click send → idempotent or safe duplicate with toast
- [ ] Missing `static_files` on new email functions → ENOENT in prod — copy config.toml pattern from `transition-booking` / `send-sd-refund-form-email`

---

## Scope

### In

1. Inventory + this plan (done here).
2. Four new admin edge functions (or one multiplexed `send-booking-workflow-email` with typed `kind`) for GAF / pet / ack / ready — prefer **one multiplexed function** to cut deploy surface, matching shared emailService senders.
3. Wire **parking-broadcast** + all manual sends into booking-detail UI (Automation Triggers and/or plan-skip callout).
4. Fix misleading Free copy (advance guide + effects preview + toast actions).
5. Email Automations settings: plan-aware display for the six gated toggles.
6. Docs: booking-workflow, matrix residual, route guide, QA 03, PROJECT API table, edge-functions inventory.
7. Verification: Free E2E script/checklist + Starter smoke for auto path.

### Out (unless pulled in explicitly)

- Gating PDF generation or public guest form (do **not**)
- Replacing marketplace parking with Free “broadcast-first” product
- AI Next-step banner (P3.1) — separate polish
- New DB columns for every email “last sent” if activity log suffices — decide in implementation
- Changing which emails are plan-gated (keep Phase 5 matrix)
- Parking interim ungated features / org team permissions plans

---

## Approach (recommended)

### A. Server: multiplexed manual send

**Preferred:** `supabase/functions/send-booking-workflow-email/index.ts`

```text
POST { bookingId, kind: 'gaf_request' | 'pet_request' | 'booking_acknowledgement' | 'ready_for_checkin' | 'parking_broadcast' | 'sd_refund_form_request' }
```

- Auth + scope like `send-sd-refund-form-email`.
- Each kind: status / precondition guards (PDF present, `need_parking`, pets, etc.).
- Always `rawPropertyAutomationEnabled` for the matching toggle key.
- Reuse `emailService` senders already used by orchestrator.
- Optionally deprecate thin wrappers later; keep `send-sd-refund-form-email` + `parking-broadcast-email` as thin aliases initially to avoid breaking anything.

**Alternative:** four new functions + wire parking — more config.toml / static_files duplication.

### B. UI: Manual sends surface

1. **Persistent callout** when last transition returned skips **or** when booking is in a status where a plan-blocked email would normally apply and hasn’t been sent (heuristic or explicit flags).
2. Extend **Automation Triggers** (or rename to **Emails** on Free) with contextual Send buttons — minimal labels (`Send GAF request`, `Send acknowledgement`, …).
3. Toast action: primary **Send** / secondary Upgrade — or open Automation Triggers.

Follow `ui-minimal-copy` — no essays; short labels + errors only.

### C. Settings

On Free (or whenever `!automatedBookingFlow`): show TierBadge / lock on the six gated toggles; allow viewing defaults; saving ON still won’t fire auto (server truth) — prefer disable + upgrade modal over silent lie.

### D. Copy

Make `pipelineAdvanceGuide` / effects copy **plan-aware** via `useFeatureGate('automatedBookingFlow')` (or entitlements already on property plan query).

## Implementation tasks (ordered)

1. **Lock decisions** — multiplexed vs separate functions; whether to add `*_emailed_at` columns; Free settings UX (lock vs watermark).
2. **Competitive UX brief** (short) for Manual sends panel — PMS patterns.
3. **Server** — implement send path(s) + `config.toml` `static_files` + permission leaf.
4. **Client hooks** — mutations mirroring `useResendSdRefundFormEmail`.
5. **UI** — Automation Triggers expansion + plan-skip callout + toast actions.
6. **Copy** — `workflowAdvanceMode`, effects copy, featureGateCopy if needed.
7. **Settings** — Email Automations plan awareness.
8. **Docs** — list below.
9. **Verify** — Free E2E + Starter smoke; update QA 03.
10. **`/workflow-start`** → move this file to `in-progress/` when coding begins; `/workflow-done` when shipped.

| 8    | Complete refund → COMPLETED        | —                | Graph complete                                                                      |

Also: create booking from admin UI if product supports it; cancel path; D2 empty-requirements property.

### Starter+ smoke

Same transitions → emails auto-fire; manual sends still work as resend; no false `automationSkippedByPlan`.

## Open questions (resolve before / during `/workflow-start`)

1. **One multiplexed function vs four+ wrappers?** (Recommend multiplexed.)
2. **Persist “sent at” for GAF/ack/ready/pet?** Or toast-only + optional activity?
3. **Should Free Email Automations toggles be disabled** or left editable for “when I upgrade”?
4. **Parking broadcast on Free:** still useful post-marketplace, or hide unless legacy unlinked `need_parking`?
5. **Toast primary CTA:** Send vs Upgrade — product preference for conversion vs ops?
