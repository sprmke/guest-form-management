# Public operational guest pages — multi-tenant readiness

> **For agentic workers:** Follow tasks in order. Checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. Counterpart shipped work: [`../done/guest-form-configurable-sections.md`](../done/guest-form-configurable-sections.md).

## Context

Operational guest pages (`/properties/:propertySlug/...`) still show **Kame Home / Monaco 2604 / Azure North** in shared shell UI (`KameFormBrandHeader`, `MainLayout` hero/footer) and Azure-specific instructional copy in the guest form and pay-parking flow.

Guest form **logic** was generalized in guest-form-configurable-sections (section toggles, capacity, check times, Direct source). This plan completes **branding + copy** for prod multi-tenant readiness.

**Scope (locked):** Operational property flows only — calendar, form, success, sd-form, guest-review, pay-parking, stay-guide, property chat.

**Hero banner (locked):** Org **brand color** gradient band in `MainLayout` (no image upload).

## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: `MainLayout` brand-color header band (org hero upload removed)
- [x] Task 2: `guestFormSettings` + extend `get-guest-payment-info`
- [x] Task 3: `GuestFormBrandHeader` + `MainLayout`
- [x] Task 4: Guest form copy + tower default + contact labels
- [x] Task 5: Success, SD form, pay-parking + booking endpoints
- [x] Task 6: Docs + `type-check` / `lint` / `build` + manual smoke

---

## Verification

1. Kame Home / Azure: visual parity when copy overrides unset (Azure dev defaults seeded in code).
2. Second test property: eyebrow shows property + residence; no Monaco strings.
3. Org brand color updates all operational pages under that org's properties.
4. Pay parking: dynamic eyebrow + org hero (screenshot case fixed).
5. `curl get-guest-payment-info?property=<slug>` returns branding fields.

All verified 2026-08-09 (`bun run type-check`, `lint`, `build`; route guides + `docs/PROJECT.md` updated; loading skeletons no longer use legacy `KameFormBrandHeader`).

## Completion status

**Done** — shipped 2026-08-03 through 2026-08-09 (Task 6 closed 2026-08-09).

**Restore note (2026-08-03):** After a shell-redesign attempt + revert wiped chrome, operational branding was re-applied on the existing `MainLayout` path (brand-color band, no cover image / texture, `GuestFormBrandHeader` + dynamic footer). The separate shell redesign plan remains in `docs/workflow/planned/property-public-pages-shell-redesign.md` and was **not** re-executed in that restore.

### Post-ship delta (2026-08-09)

- **Task 6:** Route guides updated (`sd-form.md`, `bookings/parking.md`); `docs/PROJECT.md` operational branding section; `GuestPageSkeletons` uses neutral header skeleton (removed legacy `KameFormBrandHeader.tsx`).
- **D5 (`guestFormCopy`):** Per-property JSONB override not shipped — instructional copy uses **`guestFormBranding.ts`** templates keyed off `residenceName` / org name from **`get-guest-payment-info`** (Azure/Kame parity when residence matches seeded defaults).
- **Hero image migration:** `guest_hero_image_url` was never added; brand-color band only — no migration required.
