# Parking E2E — Phase 1a (Guest Side): Request Submission & Realtime Status

Part of the [Parking E2E Phase 0/1 plan set](./parking-e2e-phase1-overview.md). Depends on [Phase 1c](./parking-e2e-phase1-status-workflow.md) and [Doc 3](./parking-e2e-phase1-host-broadcast-notifications.md).

**Goal:** Replace the mock Reserve submit with a real public edge call; show a guest status page that updates live when a host claims, declines-all, or TTL expires — including endorsement note after accept.

## Context

| File                                                                         | Reality                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/pages/ParkingFormPage.tsx`                  | Loads mock `dev-parking-form`, wraps shared `FormPageWrapper`                 |
| `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/forms/components/FormPageWrapper.tsx:57-62` | `sleep(2000)` + fake ID — **also used by property/development forms**         |
| Discovery                                                                    | Real: `usePublicParkingDetail` / `usePublicParkings`                          |
| Reserve gate                                                                 | `useParkingReserve` already requires guest auth before navigating to the form |

**Do not** put the real parking submit only inside `FormPageWrapper` without an opt-in — that would silently affect other marketing forms still on mocks.

## Submit — `submit-parking-booking-request`

`servePublic`, validate body:

```ts
type SubmitParkingBookingRequest = {
  organizationId: string; // required
  parkingId?: string; // optional pin
  checkInDate: string; // YYYY-MM-DD → normalize to DB convention via shared utils
  checkOutDate: string;
  vehicleType: 'car' | 'motorcycle';
  primaryGuestName: string;
  guestEmail: string;
  guestPhone?: string;
  // additional fields from form schema as needed
};
```

Flow:

1. Resolve org exists; if `parkingId`, verify it belongs to that org and is `ACTIVE`.
2. Run candidate query (Doc 3). If empty → **422** `{ error: 'no_parking_available' }` — no insert.
3. Insert `guest_submissions`: `status = 'PENDING_HOST_ACCEPTANCE'`, `parking_id = null`, `parking_request_organization_id`, `requested_vehicle_type`, `parking_broadcast_expires_at`, guest fields, stay dates.
4. `fanOutParkingBroadcast(...)`.
5. Return `{ bookingId, expiresAt, status }`.

**Pinned listing:** still null `parking_id` until claim; one broadcast row for that parking (uniform path).

### Form wiring

- Add optional `onSubmit?: (data) => Promise<{ submissionId: string }>` to `FormPageWrapper`.
- When provided, call it instead of the mock; on success show `FormSuccess` and navigate to status route (or link from success).
- `ParkingFormPage` supplies `onSubmit` → edge function; pass `organizationId` + `parkingId` from `usePublicParkingDetail`.
- Property/development pages: leave default mock until their own e2e.

Vehicle type: required field on parking form (mock schema update or replace mock form with Zod+RHF parking-specific fields — prefer extending the parking form schema so `vehicleType` is explicit).

## Guest status page

**Route:** `/parkings/requests/:bookingId` (add to `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/routes/index.tsx`).

**Page:** `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/parkings/pages/ParkingRequestStatusPage.tsx` inside `ParkingPublicBrandShell` when it fits; otherwise same marketing shell as other public parking pages.

**Bearer capability:** unguessable UUID in URL (same pattern as other guest links). Do **not** list endpoints.

### Read path (security)

Prefer **edge function** `get-parking-booking-status` (public) returning only:

```ts
{
  status: ParkingStatus;
  checkInDate: string;
  checkOutDate: string;
  expiresAt: string | null;
  parkingLabel: string | null; // after claim
  endorsementNote: string | null;
  organizationName: string | null;
}
```

Service role loads by id; 404 if not a parking-request row (`parking_request_organization_id IS NOT NULL` or `parking_id IS NOT NULL` without `property_id`).

**Realtime:** after initial fetch, subscribe with anon client:

- Option A (preferred if workable): `postgres_changes` on a **security barrier view** `parking_booking_guest_status` that exposes only safe columns and `SELECT` for `anon` **using** `id = booking_id` is not expressible in RLS without the id — so typically **Realtime still needs a policy**. Practical v1: poll the edge function every 5s **plus** attempt Realtime on `guest_submissions` filtered by `id=eq.{bookingId}` only if a narrow RLS policy allows `SELECT` of non-PII columns for rows where `parking_request_organization_id IS NOT NULL` **and** the client passes the exact id (Supabase Realtime filter). Harden with column-limited view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW public.parking_booking_guest_status AS
SELECT id, status, parking_broadcast_expires_at AS expires_at,
       parking_endorsement_note AS endorsement_note,
       /* join label after claim */
FROM guest_submissions WHERE property_id IS NULL
  AND (parking_id IS NOT NULL OR parking_request_organization_id IS NOT NULL);
-- RLS: grant SELECT to anon; policy USING (true) is unsafe if view is enumerable.
```

**Locked approach for production:**

1. Initial + fallback: `get-parking-booking-status`.
2. Realtime: private channel via edge-issued short-lived token **or** authenticated guest session already required by `requireGuestAuth` — **use the logged-in guest JWT** and RLS `auth.uid()` ownership if we store `guest_user_id` on submit.

Check whether parking submit can set `guest_user_id` / auth uid from the guest session (guest portal identity). If yes:

- Column `guest_auth_user_id UUID` on submit from JWT.
- RLS: guest can `SELECT` limited columns where `guest_auth_user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Realtime mirrors guest chat (`useGuestChat` + `supabase.realtime.setAuth`).

If guest JWT is not reliably present at submit, fall back to **edge polling every 3–5s** on the status page for v1 and document Realtime-as-fast-follow — but overview promised Realtime; **prefer attaching `guest_auth_user_id`** because `useParkingReserve` already forces auth.

**Lock:** require guest session on submit; persist `guest_auth_user_id`; Realtime + SELECT policy scoped to that uid; status page also works with booking id deep link when same user is logged in. Unauthenticated deep link: edge fetch only (no Realtime) until login.

**What actually shipped (2026-08-16):** the `guest_auth_user_id` / RLS / Realtime channel path above was never implemented. `useParkingBookingStatus` instead polls `get-parking-booking-status` every 4s unconditionally (terminal statuses stop polling), which satisfies this doc's own "≤5s poll fallback" acceptance bar (§Verification) but is not what "Realtime status page" promises. Documenting this explicitly as the accepted v1 approach rather than an unnoticed gap — implementing true Realtime is still open if product wants the truly-live experience later.

## Endorsement

Host passes `endorsementNote` on claim (Doc 3). Status page shows it when `status === 'PENDING_REVIEW'` (or later). Not a PDF upload (legacy property parking request stays separate).

## States to design for (Operate mode)

| State           | UI                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waiting         | Status badge + countdown to `expiresAt`                         |
| Accepted        | Parking label + endorsement note                                |
| No host         | Short message + support/contact link if product already has one |
| Cancelled       | Short terminal state                                            |
| Loading / error | Skeleton; retry on edge failure                                 |

Minimal copy only.

### Task 1: Submit edge + form wiring

**Files:**

- Create: `supabase/functions/submit-parking-booking-request/index.ts`
- Modify: `FormPageWrapper.tsx` (optional `onSubmit`)
- Modify: `ParkingFormPage.tsx`
- Modify: mock/parking form schema for `vehicleType`
- Modify: `supabase/config.toml`

- [x] 422 on zero candidates; happy path returns `bookingId`.
- [ ] Commit.

---

### Task 2: Status edge + page + Realtime

**Files:**

- Create: `get-parking-booking-status/index.ts`
- Create: `ParkingRequestStatusPage.tsx`
- Modify: marketing routes
- Migration slice if `guest_auth_user_id` + RLS (may live in Doc 2 migration — add there if not already)

- [x] Two-tab test: host claim → guest UI updates without refresh (Realtime) or ≤5s (poll fallback). (poll fallback confirmed by code — 4s interval; live two-tab run not re-verified this session)
- [x] Confirm other booking ids are not readable. (`get-parking-booking-status` requires exact UUID, no list/enumeration endpoint, 404s identically for missing/non-parking rows)
- [ ] Mobile 375px. (needs live Playwright/device verification — QA screenshots from this session were lost, see route guide)
- [x] Route guide under `docs/guides/routes/`. (`docs/guides/routes/org/parking/bookings.md` updated; guest routes documented in `docs/architecture/routing.md`; full spec in `.cursor/rules/parking-workflow.mdc`)
- [ ] Commit.

## Critical files

- `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/pages/ParkingFormPage.tsx`
- `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/forms/components/FormPageWrapper.tsx`
- `ui/src/features/guest/marketing/parkings/hooks/useParkingReserve.ts`

- `ui/src/features/guest/chat/hooks/useGuestChat.ts` — Realtime auth pattern reference
- Public parking edge precedents: `get-public-parking`, `list-public-parkings`

## Verification

1. Pin listing → one broadcast; host notified.
2. Org-level any-available (when UI exists) → multi broadcast; until UI exists, exercise via direct edge call with only `organizationId`.
3. Live status update on claim.
4. Unauthorized uid cannot Realtime-subscribe to another guest’s booking.
5. `bun run lint && bun run type-check && bun run build`.
