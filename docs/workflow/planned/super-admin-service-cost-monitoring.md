# Super Admin — service cost control & optimization

**Spun out of** the Sept 2026 infrastructure cost audit (`docs/workflow/intake/_to-prompt.md`
→ "Check current functionalities … that may cost us"). The audit inventoried every metered
external service GFM depends on. This plan makes the app **cheap to run at scale and
profitable**: every metered call is attributed and budgeted, every guest-initiated expensive
action is capped server-side, and the app **degrades to a cheaper path before it overspends**
instead of producing a surprise invoice.

## Non-negotiables (the cost contract)

1. **Attribution** — every metered external call (email, AI token, voice minute, map load,
   payment) records `organization_id` + `property_id` so spend maps to the tenant causing it.
2. **Server-side caps** — every guest-initiated expensive action has a hard per-actor **and**
   per-tenant cap enforced in an edge function, never only in the client.
3. **Degrade before overspend** — when a service crosses its budget the app automatically
   switches to a cheaper path (static map, cached AI, queued email, sampled analytics) and
   alerts; it never silently 429s a guest flow and never blows past a paid ceiling unwatched.
4. **One control plane** — every limit is a super-admin-editable row, not a hard-coded
   constant. Changing a plan or a provider tier is an `UPDATE`, not a deploy.
5. **Cost follows the plan** — each metered service maps to a plan entitlement; a tenant that
   exceeds its allowance hits an upgrade hook or draws down purchased credits (the AI credit
   wallet already does this — generalize it).

## Pre-implementation review — binding amendments (2026-09-06)

The plan below was reviewed against the codebase before implementation. These amendments
**override** the corresponding sections. Read them first.

### Blockers (the section below is wrong without these)

- **A1 · Runtime config delivery.** `app-settings` and `platform-settings` are both
  admin / super-admin gated — a public property page and `ui/src/lib/posthog/client.ts` at
  boot **cannot read them**. Therefore:
  - `maps_mode` is returned in the response body of `get-public-property`,
    `get-public-showcase`, and `get-public-host` (the map components already call these).
    `PropertyLocationPicker` (admin) reads it from `app-settings` as normal.
  - `analytics_mode` + `realtime_scope` + `dashboard_poll_seconds` are served by a **new
    public `get-public-app-config`** edge fn (`verify_jwt = false`, 5-min CDN cache,
    returns a tiny JSON blob). The SPA fetches it once on boot, writes to `localStorage`;
    `posthog/client.ts` reads `localStorage` **synchronously with a safe hard-coded
    default** (`sampled` in prod), then the async fetch updates the value for the next
    load. Never block init on the network.
  - Every runtime flag has a compiled-in default so a missing/broken row or a failed fetch
    can never brick a guest page.

- **A2 · Voice cost ceiling is cooperative, not enforced.** After `voice-receptionist-start`
  mints the ephemeral token the session is browser ↔ Google directly and the token is
  **not revocable**. Replace "per-session USD watchdog that force-ends the call" with:
  1. Hard stop = the ephemeral token TTL, already derived from `maxSessionSeconds` (keep).
  2. When the property or platform is near its voice budget, `enforceVoiceReceptionistCaps`
     mints the **next** session with a shorter `maxSessionSeconds` and/or a lower
     `maxSessionsPerGuestPerDay` (dynamic tightening).
  3. Client `useVoiceSession.ts` runs its own countdown to `maxSessionSeconds`, plays a
     spoken "I have to wrap up", and closes the socket.
  4. Optional: client POSTs `voice-receptionist-heartbeat` every 30s; if the response says
     "over budget" the client tears down. Cooperative — a hostile client can ignore it, but
     the token TTL still bounds the blast radius.

- **A3 · Raw-event retention is a first-class task, not a footnote.**
  `platform_service_usage_events` is append-only on an 8 GB Pro DB.
  - The **daily rollup is the source of truth** for the console and `serviceGuard`; raw
    events are audit/debug only.
  - New nightly `platform-service-events-retention` cron purges raw events older than
    **60 days** (rollup kept indefinitely).
  - The Google Maps beacon is **client-sampled** (default 1-in-5, sample rate in
    `get-public-app-config`) so map loads do not write 1:1; the console scales the sampled
    count back up.
  - Add monthly `RANGE` partitioning on `platform_service_usage_events` only if observed
    volume exceeds ~1M rows/month (note as a follow-up, not P2).

- **A4 · `emailClass` is optional, default `'transactional'`.** Making it required risks a
  missed call site among the 11 `emailService` senders + `workflowOrchestrator`. Default to
  the always-sends class so a missed site fails safe. Add a CI grep that **warns** (not
  errors) on a send call without an explicit class. Migrate call sites incrementally in D2.

### Should-fix (fold into the phase that touches them)

- **A5 · Metering + enforcement kill switches.** New singleton flags
  `platform_service_metering_enabled` and `platform_service_enforcement_enabled` (default
  metering **on**, enforcement **off**). `recordServiceUsage` no-ops when metering is off;
  `serviceGuard` returns `allow` when enforcement is off. Ship P2–P3 with enforcement off.
- **A6 · Seed every `platform_service_limits` row `on_hard = 'alert_only'`.** A documented
  per-service promotion checklist moves a row to `degrade`, then `block`, only after N days
  of clean data at real traffic. P4 wires the mechanism; it stays passive until deliberately
  promoted.
- **A7 · All metering windows are UTC**, matching the existing AI metering
  (`new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)`, `getUTC*`). The `notes` column on each
  `platform_service_limits` row records the provider's real reset TZ (Maps = Pacific,
  PostHog = account TZ, Resend ≈ UTC) so the end-of-period projection can offset. Do not
  introduce `Asia/Manila` into metering.
- **A8 · Environment guard.** `recordServiceUsage`, `service-health-alert-cron`,
  `service-metrics-sync`, `platform-service-events-retention`, and `email-outbox-drain` all
  early-return unless `Deno.env.get('ENVIRONMENT') === 'production'`. Local/staging write and
  call nothing.
- **A9 · `service-metrics-sync` credentials are sensitive.** Supabase Management API token
  (full account), PostHog personal API key, Vercel token. Least-privilege / read-only tokens
  where the provider allows; store only in that one function's secrets; never log; document
  rotation in the migration runbook.
- **A10 · `serviceGuard` on hot read paths.** For read-mostly flags (`maps_mode`) resolve
  from a settings row the handler already loads, **not** a separate guard call. Reserve the
  live-rollup read for enforceable write paths (email send, AI call, voice mint). The guard's
  rollup read has a 50 ms timeout → fail-open. Cache the rollup in an isolate-level memo
  keyed by `(service, metric, scopeKey)` with a 60 s TTL (accepting a low hit rate on
  recycled isolates — correctness does not depend on the cache).
- **A11 · Parking is a first-class scope.** Add `per_parking` to `platform_service_limits.scope`
  and `platform_service_tenant_limits`; the by-tenant drill-down is org → (property | parking);
  Part G maps parking plan entitlements too. `parking_id` is already on the event table.
- **A12 · Backfill on ship.** One-time: AI from `ai_platform_usage_events`, PayMongo from
  `parking_payment_transactions` + `org_subscription_events`, Resend from the Resend API
  (last 30 d) if the endpoint allows. Maps / PostHog / Vercel start at ship date (note the
  gap in the console).
- **A13 · Alert escalation.** Re-send a `hard` / `over` alert every 8 h while still breached
  (not only on tier change); `soft` stays once per period; send a "recovered" note on drop
  below `soft_pct`.
- **A14 · PayMongo `fee_php` is primary** (rail-derived, deterministic); `fee_usd` is derived
  via a super-admin-editable monthly FX constant row. Console labels PayMongo cost
  "indicative".
- **A15 · D6 bundle split is its own PR.** `ui/vite.config.ts` has custom Polotno plugins
  (`patchOpenPolotnoHighlighter`, `buildScopedPolotnoBlueprintCss`) + `VitePWA` with a
  precache budget. `manualChunks` must land with a committed before/after bundle report,
  the Polotno blueprint CSS scoping re-verified, and `scripts/pwa/check-precache-budget.mjs`
  green in the same PR — nothing else bundled in.
- **A16 · `realtime_scope: open_thread_only` is a degrade mode only**, never the default. It
  kicks in at the Supabase realtime soft threshold; the default stays today's behaviour.
  Document the operator-facing tradeoff (inbox list falls back to a 30 s poll).

### Rollback levers (per risky change)

| Change                              | Instant revert                                                                          |

## Part A — Per-service control matrix (super admin)

Every service gets: a **metered metric + window**, a **super-admin knob**, an **enforcement
point in code**, a **soft-degrade** behaviour at ≥ `soft_pct` (default 75%), and a **hard
action** at ≥ 100%. Knobs live in `platform_service_limits` (global) +
`platform_service_tenant_limits` (per org/property override) unless noted.

**`email_class`** is a new **optional** argument on every `emailService` send, **default
`'transactional'`** (see amendment A4 — a missed call site must still send):
`transactional` (guest-blocking: payment, refund form, check-in, OTP, approval),
`operational` (host digests, reminders, staff alerts — mostly already on Telegram; max
queue delay 2 h then send anyway), `marketing` (announcements, review nudges, broadcasts;
max queue delay 24 h then drop + dead-letter). Only `operational` and `marketing` are
subject to soft-degrade / queueing; `transactional` always sends.

≈10,000/mo per SKU — verify each, Gemini monthly USD budget, PostHog 5,000 recordings,
Supabase Pro quotas, voice per-property minutes), **every row `on_hard = 'alert_only'`**
(amendment A6). Set `reset_tz` per provider. Every row editable in the console; promote to
`degrade` / `block` per the checklist only after clean data at real traffic.

### Instrumentation — where events are written

Every write is **fire-and-forget** (`EdgeRuntime.waitUntil` / non-awaited) so metering never
adds latency to a send or a payment.

`recordServiceUsage(service, metric, quantity, opts)` — one new helper in
`_shared/serviceUsageService.ts`, modelled on `aiUsageService.ts#recordAiUsage`: writes the
event and upserts both the tenant-scoped and the `NULL` platform-level daily rollup rows.

### Alert cron — `service-health-alert-cron`

`serveCronPost` + `SERVICE_HEALTH_CRON_SECRET`, every 30 min via hosted `pg_cron` + `pg_net`
(same migration shape as `20261301130000_sd_refund_cron_secret_schedule.sql`).

Each run: for every `platform_service_limits` row (and any `platform_service_tenant_limits`
override), compute current-window consumption from `platform_service_usage_daily` + today's
live events; `pct = consumed / limit`; tier = `over` (≥100) / `hard` (≥ hard_pct) / `soft`
(≥ soft_pct). Notify only when the tier is **new or escalated** vs `platform_service_alert_state`:

- **Email** — `emailService` (`email_class: operational`, exempt from its own degrade) →
  `SUPPORT_TEAM_EMAIL` + `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`, template `service-limit-alert.html` (service,
  consumed / limit, pct, projected end-of-period, top 3 tenants, link to `/admin/service-health`).
- **Telegram** — `_shared/telegramAdmin.ts` → admin chat, one line:
  `⚠️ Resend email 82% of monthly cap (2,460 / 3,000). Top: Sunrise Villas 41%, Bayview 22%. → /admin/service-health`
- Upsert alert state. New `period_key` resets automatically; stamp `resolved_at` + send a
  "recovered" note when consumption falls back under `soft_pct`.

### Read API — `super-admin-service-health`

`serveSuperAdmin`, GET, `?range=30d|90d|12mo&service=<id>`:

- `services[]` — `{ service, metric, window, scope, consumed, limit, pct, tier, onHard, projectedEndOfPeriod, unit }`
- `costTrend[]` — `{ date, [service]: usd }` for the stacked area
- `byTenant[]` (when `service=`) — `{ organizationId, orgName, propertyId?, propertyName?, quantity, estimatedCostUsd, pctOfTotal }`, top 20
- `alerts[]` — active soft/hard/over breaches with top contributing tenants
- `limits[]` + `tenantLimits[]` — the editable registry rows
- `degradeState[]` — which degrade modes are currently active and why

Mutations: `super-admin-service-limits` (upsert a global or tenant limit row, `logSuperAdminAction`),
`super-admin-service-degrade` (manually force / clear a degrade mode), `super-admin-service-alert-test`.

### UI — `/admin/service-health`

- `superAdminPaths.serviceHealth = '/admin/service-health'`; add to `SUPER_ADMIN_NAV_GROUPS`
  (Platform group, next to "AI usage"); route guide `docs/guides/routes/admin/service-health.md`.
- Reuse the console scaffold (`SuperAdminPage`, `SuperAdminSettingsCard`,
  `SuperAdminSecondaryNav`); clone `SuperAdminAiCostChart.tsx` (Recharts + console theme).
- Sections: (1) **status strip** — one tile per service, gauge bar green/amber/red +
  projection marker + active degrade badge; (2) **cost trend** — stacked area USD/day by
  service; (3) **by tenant** — horizontal bar, top 10 orgs for the selected service, stacked
  by metric, with an est-cost column, drill to properties; (4) **limits & degrade** — editable
  `platform_service_limits` + `platform_service_tenant_limits` rows, per-row soft/hard %,
  `on_hard` mode, email/Telegram toggles, "force degrade now" / "clear", "send test alert";
  (5) **active alerts** — current breaches + "mute until next period".
- Hooks: `useServiceHealth(range)`, `useServiceHealthByTenant(service)`, `useUpdateServiceLimit()`,
  `useForceServiceDegrade()`.

## Part C — Enforcement & degrade engine

`_shared/serviceGuard.ts` — one function every expensive entry point calls **before** doing
the work:

```ts
type GuardDecision = { mode: 'allow' | 'degrade' | 'block'; reason?: string; tier?: 'soft'|'hard'|'over' };

serviceGuard(service: string, metric: string, ctx: {
  organizationId?: string; propertyId?: string; actorType: ActorType; window?: 'day'|'month';
}): Promise<GuardDecision>
```

Logic: first check `platform_service_metering_settings.enforcement_enabled` — if false,
return `allow` immediately (amendment A5). Otherwise read the applicable
`platform_service_limits` row (+ any tenant override) and the current rollup from
`platform_service_usage_daily` under a **50 ms timeout** (amendment A10); on timeout or any
error return `allow` and log. Isolate-level memo keyed `(service, metric, scopeKey)`, 60 s
TTL — correctness does not depend on the hit rate. Then compute `pct` and return:

- `pct < soft_pct` → `allow`
- `soft_pct ≤ pct < 100` → `degrade` (caller applies its `DEGRADE_PRESETS[service]` behaviour)
- `pct ≥ 100` and `on_hard = 'block'` → `block` (caller returns a `503` upgrade hook / queues)
- `pct ≥ 100` and `on_hard = 'degrade'` → `degrade`
- `on_hard = 'alert_only'` → `allow` (cron still alerts)

`DEGRADE_PRESETS` is a code-side map (not admin-editable — behaviour stays consistent):
`{ resend: {...}, gemini: {...}, voice: {...}, google_maps: {...}, meta_graph: {...} }` with
the soft-degrade / hard-action rows from Part A. Manual overrides come from
`super-admin-service-degrade` writing a short-lived row read by `serviceGuard`.

**Call sites to wire:**

| Entry point                                                       | Guard call                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `_shared/emailService.ts` send wrapper                            | `serviceGuard('resend','email_sent',{ org, property, actorType })` — `degrade` skips `marketing` + second-nudge `operational`; `block` → `email_outbox` for non-transactional                     |
| `aiUsageService.ts#assertWithinQuota`                             | already enforces per-tenant; **add** `serviceGuard('gemini','usd',{ window:'month' })` for the platform ceiling + degrade routing (`flash → flash_lite`, TTL bump)                                |
| `voice-receptionist-start`                                        | `serviceGuard('voice','session_minutes',{ property })` before minting the token; near-budget → mint with shorter `maxSessionSeconds` (amendment A2); client self-ends, token TTL is the hard stop |
| `get-public-property` / `get-public-showcase` / `get-public-host` | **no `serviceGuard` call** (amendment A10) — the handler resolves `mapsMode` from the metering-settings row it already loads and returns it in the body; the alert cron watches the Maps rollup   |
| `meta-inbox-send` / `publish-to-meta`                             | `serviceGuard('meta_graph','rate_limit_pct')` → back off / queue                                                                                                                                  |

Fail-open: any `serviceGuard` error or timeout returns `allow` and logs — metering must never
take down a guest flow. Enforcement is also globally disableable
(`platform_service_metering_settings.enforcement_enabled`, ships `false`).

**Minimum viable for launch:** P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 (metering + alerts, enforcement still off).
P4 makes it self-protecting; P5–P6 make it scale profitably. Do not onboard paying tenants
before P0 + P1. Ship P2–P3 with `platform_service_enforcement_enabled = false` and every
limit `alert_only` — observe real traffic for at least one full billing period before
promoting any service to `degrade` / `block` in P4.

## Part F — Pre-launch load & cost checklist

- [ ] P0 caps verified on every provider (screenshots in the runbook)
- [ ] Google Maps key restricted; `curl` from an unlisted origin is rejected
- [ ] Load test: 500 concurrent guest sessions on a property page → Google Maps loads = 0
      (static/embed mode), Supabase realtime connections bounded, edge invocation rate within Pro
- [ ] Load test: 50 bookings/hour through the full workflow → emails/hour projected under the
      Resend day cap, or `email_outbox` absorbs the overflow
- [ ] Voice receptionist left OFF; switch-on checklist documented
- [ ] AI: forced platform-ceiling test → non-critical features disable, receipt validation survives
- [ ] `/admin/service-health` shows a realistic projection for every service at the tested load
- [ ] Cost model: projected monthly bill at target MoM active tenants documented and signed off
- [ ] Alert cron test: soft + hard alert delivered to email + Telegram within one cron cycle

## Part G — Profit alignment (cost ↔ plan)

Each metered service maps to a plan entitlement so heavy use pays for itself:

| Service            | Free / base plan allowance                               | Overage behaviour                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email              | monthly transactional allowance per plan tier            | soft cap → operational email throttled; upgrade hook                                                  |
| AI text            | monthly credit allowance (wallet exists)                 | draw down purchased credits, then upgrade hook (`AiQuotaExceededError` already carries `upgradeHook`) |
| Voice receptionist | paid add-on only; per-property monthly minute bundle     | over bundle → disabled until next period or top-up                                                    |
| Google Maps        | interactive maps = higher tier; base tier = static/embed | n/a (cost already near-zero on static/embed)                                                          |
| Storage            | per-plan GB                                              | over → prompt to archive or upgrade                                                                   |

`platform_service_tenant_limits` doubles as the "we sold this org a bigger bundle" record.
The super-admin console is where support raises a ceiling or blocks an abuser.

## Non-goals / cautions

- **Not a billing system of record.** All figures are estimates; reconcile monthly against
  real provider invoices. Show a "last reconciled" date per service.
- **`serviceGuard` fails open.** A metering/DB error must never block a guest flow — return
  `allow`, log, let the cron alert.
- **Transactional email is never degraded.** Payment instructions, refund forms, check-in
  details, OTP, and approval emails always send; only `operational` / `marketing` classes queue.
- Maps beacon is client-side, sampled, best-effort — a leading indicator, not the bill.
- Event writes are fire-and-forget only; raw events are purged at 60 days (amendment A3).
- These tables are service-role-only, read exclusively through `serveSuperAdmin` edge functions.
- Runtime flags each have a compiled-in default so a missing/broken row or failed
  `get-public-app-config` fetch can never brick a guest page (amendment A1).
- All metering is inert outside `ENVIRONMENT === 'production'` (amendment A8).
- Metering / enforcement each have a one-flip kill switch (amendment A5); enforcement ships off.

## Coverage check — services confirmed in / out of scope

**In scope (metered):** Resend, Gemini, Groq, voice receptionist (Gemini Live), Google Maps
Platform, PayMongo, Supabase Pro (DB / storage / egress / edge / realtime / MAU), PostHog,
Vercel, Meta Graph API.

**Checked, nothing to meter:** Supabase image transformations (not used — client-side
`browser-image-compression` + custom optimizer); Telegram Bot API (free); Cloudflare
Turnstile (free); Web Push / VAPID (free, self-served); pg_cron / pg_net (Supabase compute,
covered under edge). Supabase Auth OTP / magic-link email: free on the built-in mailer;
**counts under Resend** if custom SMTP is ever wired — add an `email_class: transactional`
meter there when that happens.

**Confirmed absent from the codebase:** Twilio / any SMS, SendGrid / Mailgun, Cloudinary /
imgix, Mapbox, Algolia, Sentry, Datadog / LogRocket, OpenAI / Anthropic, ElevenLabs /
Deepgram, Stripe, Firebase / FCM, AWS S3 / CloudFront, any paid CDN.

**Licensing (not a runtime bill — track, don't meter):** Remotion Company License at 4+
people; Jamendo content licensing for commercially published marketing video.

## Testing strategy (no automated suite in this repo)

- **Edge functions:** Deno test runner for `serviceUsageService.ts` (rollup math, env guard,
  fail-open), `serviceGuard.ts` (tier boundaries, timeout → allow), the alert cron
  (dedupe + escalation), the FX / fee helpers.
- **Migrations:** `bun run db:migrate` locally; verify the atomic `increment_*` function
  under concurrent writes with a small load script.
- **Enforcement / degrade:** integration test per service — seed a `platform_service_limits`
  row at 100%, flip `platform_service_enforcement_enabled = true`, assert the degrade
  behaviour and that transactional email / receipt validation still pass; flip the switch
  off and assert baseline restored.
- **UI:** drive `/admin/service-health` with Playwright MCP (`verify` skill) — status strip
  renders, limit edit round-trips, "send test alert" delivers.
- **Load:** Part F checklist — 500 concurrent property-page loads, 50 bookings/hour.
- Every phase PR runs `bun run lint && type-check && check:filenames && build` (CI) plus the
  phase's acceptance criteria manually verified and noted in the PR.

## Docs to update when this ships

- `docs/PROJECT.md` — new tables + kill-switch flags, `/admin/service-health` route,
  `service-health-alert-cron`, `email-outbox-drain`, `service-metrics-sync`,
  `storage-retention-cron`, `platform-service-events-retention` cron,
  `SERVICE_HEALTH_CRON_SECRET`, `service-usage-beacon`, `get-public-app-config`,
  `voice-receptionist-heartbeat`, the runtime config flags (served via `get-public-app-config`
  - public property responses, not `app-settings`)
- `docs/guides/routes/admin/service-health.md` — new route guide (invoke `route-guides`)
- `.cursor/rules/admin-auth.mdc` — new `serveSuperAdmin` endpoints
- `.cursor/rules/supabase-edge-functions.mdc` — new crons + the public beacon JWT policy
- `.cursor/rules/booking-workflow.mdc` — email-class change touches `workflowOrchestrator` sends
- `docs/architecture/plans-feature-matrix.md` + `plans-and-permissions` skill — Part G entitlements
- `docs/archive/operations/scheduled-jobs-and-testing.md` + `migration-runbook.md` — new crons + retention job
- `.cursor/rules/performance.mdc` / `performance` skill — bundle-split + poll/realtime defaults
