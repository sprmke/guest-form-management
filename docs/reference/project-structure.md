# UI project structure

**Canonical rule:** `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`  
**Last reorganized:** 2026-07-09 (guest / dashboard context split)

Adapted from [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) and Kame Homes PMA patterns.

## Layer flow

```
shared (components/, hooks/, lib/, utils/, layouts/)
  → features/guest/ | features/dashboard/
    → routes/ (thin composition)
```

Shared code never imports from features. Features may import shared + (sparingly) other features during migration — prefer composing at route level.

## Shared `lib/` (by category)

```
lib/
  supabase/client.ts       # Supabase client
  theme/                   # preferences, brandColor, applyBrandCssVariables
  validation/              # fieldValidation, adminSettings
  constants/formPlaceholders.ts
  date/navigation.ts       # admin date-range presets
  table/pagination.ts
  feedback/toastMessages.ts
  charts/                  # chartPalette, chartStyles (config, not components)
  utils.ts                 # cn() — shadcn convention; do not move
```

Domain-specific modules moved out of global `lib/`:

| Was                                        | Now                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `lib/gafDefaults.ts`, `lib/petDefaults.ts` | `features/dashboard/bookings/lib/` |
| `lib/settingsFieldLabel.ts`                | `features/dashboard/org/lib/`      |

## Shared `utils/` (by category)

```
utils/
  format/    # currency, dates, bookingDisplay
  text/      # formatters, helpers (name/file transforms)
  dev/       # mockData (guest form dev only)
```

| Was                         | Now                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `utils/bookingFormatter.ts` | `features/guest/form/lib/bookingFormatter.ts` |

## Top-level `ui/src/`

| Path                  | Role                                                                             |

| `features/dashboard/` | Admin / operator dashboard modules                                               |

| `layouts/`            | `MainLayout`, `layouts/guest/navState`                                           |
| `lib/`                | Categorized shared logic — see **Shared `lib/`** above                           |
| `routes/`             | `AppRoutes` — composes guest + dashboard trees                                   |
| `utils/`              | Categorized formatters — see **Shared `utils/`** above                           |

## Dashboard features (`features/dashboard/`)

| Module         | Scope          | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bookings/`    | Property       | Booking list, detail, workflow, templates editor, Telegram, settings pages (legacy hub — split over time) |
| `org/`         | Org            | Selector, onboarding, org/property settings, guards                                                       |

Entry: `features/dashboard/routes/index.tsx`

## Shared components layout

```
components/
  ui/           # shadcn primitives (kebab-case — do not rename)
  branding/     # KameFormBrandHeader, KameHomesBrandIcon, GoogleMark, TeamLogoMark
  navigation/   # ScrollToTop, AdminEntryButton
  charts/
  skeletons/
  theme/
  shared/
```

## Feature folder convention

Each module uses only the subfolders it needs:

```
features/{context}/{module}/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── pages/
├── routes/
├── schemas/    # guest form
└── types/
```

## Adding a module

1. Place under `features/guest/{name}/` or `features/dashboard/{name}/`.
2. Add `{name}/routes/index.tsx` and wire in the parent context router.
3. Add route guide under `docs/guides/routes/`.
4. Log moves in this file when batch-reorganizing.
