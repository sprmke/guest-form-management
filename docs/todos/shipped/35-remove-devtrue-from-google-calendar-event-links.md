## Description

~~Stop appending `dev=true` (or legacy test params) to calendar summary links shown to guests/operators.~~

New goal: We should remove these dev and other query parameter that we have from dashboard, public guest form, and all places of our app

## Shipped notes

Removed `?dev=true` / `testing` / submit-form control flags from guest & calendar URLs (strip on load). Guest API toggles are non-prod only via FormData; hosted submit-form forces full side effects. Calendar admin links already clean `/bookings/{id}`.
