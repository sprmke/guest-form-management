/**
 * Per-module starter prompts for the AI dashboard assistant.
 *
 * Each list is ranked **most common → least common** (index 0 = rank 1) based on the
 * real tool catalog (`supabase/functions/_shared/dashboardAssistant*Tools.ts`) so every
 * prompt maps to something the assistant can actually answer or do. When the host pins
 * context from the composer (booking, property, finance item, …), `selectContextualSuggestions`
 * swaps the generic random pool (`assistantSuggestions.ts`) for the ranked prompts of the
 * pinned module(s) — merging fairly by rank when multiple modules are pinned together.
 *
 * Keep in sync with `docs/architecture/ai-dashboard-assistant.md` § Context model.
