# Workflow done

Mark the active **in-progress** workflow doc as **done**.

## Steps

1. Identify the in-progress slug from `docs/workflow/in-progress/` or user message.
2. Run:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/workflow-move.sh done <slug>
```

3. Confirm docs/route guides/`PROJECT.md` updates were made per `.cursor/rules/documentation-maintenance.mdc`.
4. If work maps to a GitHub Issue, ship via `bun scripts/dev/gh-issue.mjs ship --github N`.
